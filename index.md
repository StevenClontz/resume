Research
--------

Research interests include set theoretic topology and game theory, 
particularly using the existence of perfect or limited-information strategies 
in topological games to characterize topological properties of spaces. Past 
research includes polyhedral unfoldings within solid geometry and the 
structure of linearly ordered topological spaces.
